    description: "I work within an agile development team following the Scrum framework. My main role is in backend development, where I design and implement solutions using .NET and NestJS with a strong focus on Clean Code practices. I also collaborate with the frontend team whenever features need refinement or updates. Our projects are built around Domain-Driven Design principles, and we apply the CQRS pattern to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of responsibilities. This approach allows us to tackle complex business requirements with well-structured and reliable solutions.",

After a few months, I transitioned to the Backend, where I worked with Node.js, Express.js, TypeORM, and Oracle. One of my key contributions was introducing GraphQL APIs to replace some REST endpoints, which not only streamlined development but also made our applications faster and more responsive.",

I worked with a wide range of technologies including C#, WinForms, SQL, Oracle, Oracle Forms, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and more. One of my biggest contributions was leading the development of the university’s two most important portals: the Student Portal and the Teacher Portal. These projects significantly improved design, performance, and overall user experience, making them key tools in the institution’s digital transformation.",
